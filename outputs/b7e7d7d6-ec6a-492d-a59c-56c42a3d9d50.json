Generative AI can be utilized in software development for various tasks such as decision-making, content generation, and user interface design. Natural language processing (NLP) can also allow developers to create more personalized apps and capabilities by generating more accurate response to user input. Common applications of NLP in software development are text recognition, sentiment analysis, and voice-controlled apps."
